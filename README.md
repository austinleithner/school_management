# school_management

This is a personal project practicing my skills in Django, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SQL.
It is a full-stack school management web application that allows users to add, view, and assign students, teachers, and classes to a database.
So far users can add and view students, teachers, and classes. I have yet to add a feature that allows users to assign classes to students.
This is not for a real school just a theoretical one.
